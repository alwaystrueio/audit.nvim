*audit.txt*  Plugin for taking notes about code during audits

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                           *audit*

The audit.nvim plugin allows an auditor to take notes about the code they're 
reviewing without modifying the source code. Notes are stored in a separate
"notes.md" file and linked to the lines of code they refer to.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                  *audit-usage*

The plugin adds visual indicators to lines that have associated notes and
provides a side panel that shows notes related to the current line.

Commands:
  :AuditAddNote                                        *:AuditAddNote*
    Add a note for the currently selected text. This command is only 
    available in visual mode.

  :AuditDeleteNote [id]                                *:AuditDeleteNote*
    Delete a note with the specified ID from the current file. The ID is 
    the number shown in the virtual text (e.g., "üìù Note 1").
    If no ID is provided, the command will:
      - Delete the note at the current cursor line if there's only one
      - Show a selection menu if there are multiple notes at the cursor line
      - Display a warning if no notes are found at the cursor line

Key mappings:
  <Leader>an                                           *audit-key-add-note*
    In visual mode, adds a note for the selected text.
